Hi! I am Yuchen Zhang, a researcher/engineer interested in Statistics, Natural Language Processing, and Machine 
Learning. I care deeply about science for social good and believe 
that our research in technology and algorithms should benefit the public in a safe and fair way. 

Currently, I am a Research Intern at Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems. Before this, I was a Research Engineer at Meta FAIR/GenAI/MSL for 3.5 years, working on Llama/multimodal's Trust and Safety.
